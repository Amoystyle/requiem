Requiem version 4.1


TO USE:

Double-click on the Requiem application and watch it work!
It will automatically find DRMed files in your iTunes library
and remove the DRM from them.

The original DRMed files will be moved to the trash.  Make sure you
verify that the songs and videos still work before emptying
the trash.

Windows users will need to install Java.

You can also drag & drop files or directories (which will be searched
recursively) onto the Requiem application or the Requiem window.

Starting Requiem with the shift key down will disable scanning of the
iTunes library.  You can use this feature to start requiem with a
blank window into which you can drag & drop files to be processed.


HOW IT WORKS:

Requiem decrypts the audio and video data in your file exactly
like iTunes does:

1.  Requiem authenticates with the DRM library using the secret
    credentials used by iTunes.

2.  Requiem uses the decrypt routines in the DRM library to decrypt
    all of the audio and video data.


CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

There is no longer a key cache.


WARNING:

This program is not intended to promote piracy.  I just wanted to play
my iTunes songs on a SlimServer!  As such, the output file is only
minimally modified to remove the DRM.  It still has lots of
information in it identifying you.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

BUGS:

Please report any bugs you find to the website below.  Requiem keeps a
log of the most recent run in ~/Library/Logs/Requiem.log (Mac) or
%APPDATA%\Requiem.log (Windows) which might be useful for debugging.


NOTES:

Requiem has a Tor website: http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.onion.  To reach
